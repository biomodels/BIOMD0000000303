Abstract:  
The complement system is key to innate immunity and its activation is
necessary for the clearance of bacteria and apoptotic cells. However,
insufficient or excessive complement activation will lead to immune-related
diseases. It is so far unknown how the complement activity is up- or down-
regulated and what the associated pathophysiological mechanisms are. To
quantitatively understand the modulatory mechanisms of the complement system,
we built a computational model involving the enhancement and suppression
mechanisms that regulate complement activity. Our model consists of a large
system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) accompanied by a dynamic
Bayesian network as a probabilistic approximation of the ODE dynamics.
Applying Bayesian inference techniques, this approximation was used to perform
parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis. Our combined computational and
experimental study showed that the antimicrobial response is sensitive to
changes in pH and calcium levels, which determines the strength of the
crosstalk between CRP and L-ficolin. Our study also revealed differential
regulatory effects of C4BP. While C4BP delays but does not decrease the
classical complement activation, it attenuates but does not significantly
delay the lectin pathway activation. We also found that the major inhibitory
role of C4BP is to facilitate the decay of C3 convertase. In summary, the
present work elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the complement system and
demonstrates how the bio-pathway machinery maintains the balance between
activation and inhibition. The insights we have gained could contribute to the
development of therapies targeting the complement system.
